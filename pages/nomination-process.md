<h2> Who is eligble? </h2>
Anyone who teaches a COMP course may be nominated for this award.

<h2> How do I get nominated? What we're looking for: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The course/instructor integrates history in their
    teaching
  </li>
  <li>
    The course/instructor talks about the
    environmental/social impacts of creating/using tech
  </li>
  <li>
    The course/instructor talks about the labour that goes
    into creating/making tech work
  </li>
  <li>
    The course/instructor addresses how social factors (e.g.
    relating to race, gender, ability, …) play into CS
    education and practice
  </li>
  <li>
    The course/instructor presents ethics as an integral
    part of CS
  </li>
  <li>
    The course/instructor addresses the limits of tech (i.e.
    moves away from “tech is always a good solution”)
  </li>
  <li>
    The instructor is a good teacher (i.e. they teach in a
    way makes students feel like they belong and understand
    the material) Note: We want to be wary of people who are
    nominated just because the student likes them. However,
    practicing good pedagogy is an important part of
    fostering inclusion in CS.
  </li>
  <li>
    The course/instructor challenges normative notions of
    what it means to be a computer scientist
  </li>
  <li>
    The course integrates material/historical/social aspects
    of computing throughout (not one-time thing)
  </li>
  <li>
    The course/instructor integrates
    material/historical/social aspects of computing in ways
    that are relevant to the course material (e.g. talking
    about the environmental impact of data centers when
    teaching about networks/cloud computing) note: this
    award is not targeted at courses centered around social
    issues in computing (e.g. ‘Computing and Society’), but
    courses traditionally considered “asocial” (e.g. COMP
    200, COMP 250, COMP 306, … )
  </li>
</ul>
