  Welcome to the CSUS Sustainable Teaching Award Website!
</p>

<h2>What is this award?</h2>
This student-led award rewards instructors who teach
computer science (CS) in a way that acknowledges the social
and environmental impacts of computing. In creating this
award, we hope to promote the integration of ethics,
sustainability, and social justice in computer science (CS)
education at McGill.

<h2>Why is this award necessary?</h2>

CS is taught in an immaterial way, lacking focus on the
intersecting ethical, environmental, and social justice
implications of computing. These socially disconnected
teaching practices lead students to abstract the world
around them in a way that only allows them to address
symptoms of larger socio-political issues but not the root
causes. Providing students with a full picture of computing
is necessary for CS graduates to effectively leverage CS in
their solutions to real-world issues. This means situating
CS in its social and historical context, and acknowledging
the environmental and human costs of computing. We believe
that incorporating these issues into CS education will also
improve studentsâ€™ understanding of course material.
Moreover, we hope that promoting a socially grounded
curriculum will help make CS less harmful to people and the
environment.

<h2>Who is it for?</h2>
This award is targeted at instructors who integrate social
and environmental issues into their teaching. The following
list represents some of the criteria which would make an
