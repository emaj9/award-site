Main point: Although free and open source software (FOSS) is hailed for allowing anyone to access and contribute code, the culture of FOSS exacerbates the exclusion of women from FOSS.

Key points:
Women are a tiny minority in FOSS: 1.5%.... 
“1.5 percent of F/LOSS participants are women (Ghosh et al., 2002), while women constitute 28 percent of people in technical roles in firms which rely on closed intellectual property arrangements (Evans et al., 2007; Ghosh et al., 2002).” page 670
Many women (and men) see that being a woman draws a lot of attention:
In our survey, 75% of women and 65% of men believed that it is very true or mainly true that ‘in online contexts women often get more attention as a woman rather than as a F/LOSS participant’ page 673
FOSS is a push-ocracy, not a meritocracy, and this pushes out women (and others)
FOSS emphasizes that “good code” should speak for itself -- you need only read the program’s code to ascertain it’s truth.
FOSS communities then reward those who engage in “flame wars” to assert the truth or goodness of code. These discussion are often very rude and full of vitriol (ex. Linus Tolvstad), and those who “win” flame wars (don’t back down) are rewarded for their code.
This means FOSS acceptance of new code is a pushocracy, not a meritocracy. One must push and fight to claim their code is good. This is one of the most common reasons people leave FOSS. 
Even talking about gender and women in FOSS is seen as sexist:
FOSS communities value that “anyone” can learn to code, program on their own (as many ppl in FOSS have done). Programmers think code “speaks for itself” and is free of social forces like gender. Therefore, mentioning gender disrupts this and irritates many.
“For many F/LOSS men, there was a notion that acknowledging gender at all was itself sexism.” page 673
“A male participant wrote in an online debate about a group that helps women contribute to one large software project:
I think the whole idea of ‘Debian Women’ is flawed. All it does is give / reiterate to people the idea that women are somehow different to men when it comes to computers and should be treated differently.
And from the same discussion …
Instead of saying ‘Linux geeks should be nicer to newbies,’ [the article] says ‘Guys should be nicer to women.’ No ... To ask for different treatment for different genders is SEXIST, and when the stated goal is to minimize sexism, it becomes counter-productive.”
Many men in FOSS think talking about gender reiterates an “artificial difference” between sexes. Page 673

What this means for your teaching
Talk about FOSS in your class, make students aware of the current dynamics of FOSS
Many students believe that FOSS is open (as the name suggests) and based on meritocracy. This is not exactly the case and students would benefit from having a more comprehensive awareness of FOSS culture
Value a diversity of solutions
One issue in FOSS is the insistence that there is a right and wrong way to do something. Value many ways to solve a problem in your classes.
Discuss good coding practice, ex. makes good code in your teaching (ex. Not cutting edge, but maintainable)
Another issue is the emphasis on cutting edge code, over code that is actually useful.
Make a good classroom environment
