Key Points:

- The implementation of technologies like GIS (Geographic Information System Mapping) within indigenous communities works to culturally assimilate indigenous populations
- These technologies are being promoted within the context of historically colonialist institutions
- Assuming that these tech "advances" are wanted repeats a historical and oppressive pattern of pushing Indigenous knowledge and practices to the side in favor of "modern" Westen knowledge, which is presumed to be better practice for Indigenous tribes

How This Can Be Applied To Your Teaching:

- have students consider who their work serves, and when/where it is suitable to implement it (did this community ask for it? did I check/work with the community? otherwise, who is speaking on their behalf?)
- even if the tech that is being made has positive applications, what are possible negative applications of this tech (and for who?)? Is it still worth it to create this?
- have students consider the ways that tech has historically been used (and continues to be used) for colonialist purposes (e.g. cultural assimilation)
