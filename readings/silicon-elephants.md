Key Points:
ICs have a lot of "I/O" outside of electrical pulses. Lots of chemicals put in and out, hours of labour that expose workers to these chemicals
“clean rooms” which ensure microchips are contamination-free are not meant to do the same for the workers handling them
microchips are at the root of what makes CS possible, but creating a microchip involves huge amounts of resources and fossil fuels
Ideologies of constant innovation and faster speeds (e.g. Moore’s “Law”) which have been framed as natural are dependent on the use of more and more chemicals to increase conductivity
“Speed has a necessarily material, cultural, and chemical composition” (28)
This labour and its chemical and environmental impacts are rendered invisible by the offshoring of production facilities (29)

How This Can Be Applied To Your Teaching:
Any mention to materiality, where computers come from, how they're made, will illuminate the systems of power that rely on the destruction of workers and the environment in comp production
