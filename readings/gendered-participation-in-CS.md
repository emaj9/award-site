Main point: Computing became male dominated because of social forces and ideas about what is CS/who belongs in CS. Educators can use this information to make CS more open to women

Key points:
History of women in the workforce:

Late 1800s - WW2:

- Early on, women slowly entered into science, academic, in low status positions
- These positions included “assistants” to male scientists, and “computers” tasked with doing calculations, especial for war efforts (ballistics calculations)
- WW2, women continue to expand, their work still performing “calculations” (and the “computer programmer” role emerging at this time, largely women) with men as managers/“planners”

1950s - 1970s:

- After WW2, many programming jobs were cut, and efforts to remove women from the workforce were reinstated (ex. Canada reinstate married women cannot work in government)
- Many women still worked in computing: training men (who often took their job) and ex. Programming ENIAC while men worked as “planners”
- Managers began hiring more ppl with university degrees (exclusionary practice university access was constrained by race, gender)
- Managers, not know how to program, put unreasonable workloads on workers. This lead to the asocial programmer stereotype, which lead managers to believe these were desirable qualities in a programmer 0.0
- Personality tests were common in hiring, selecting asocial individuals as preferable and framed programming as a mix of logic and math ability (already male dominated fields)
- 50s “software engineering” emerges to improve status of computing (not engineering at the time was comprised of 1.2% women).
- History of women in academic CS/university CS:
- 60s: first CS course emerge
- 1969: first CS undergrad program opens at MIT
- 70s: CS typically offered through electrical engineering or mathematics
- CS largely undefined in this time. What is CS exactly?
- 80s: Booming interest in CS
- Rise of the personal computer, and home gaming consoles (ex. Nintendo)
- Lots of women were in CS at the time, about 35%
- Universities were ill equipped to deal with enrollment boom: introduction of additional requirements like GPA thresholds which hurt women [cite other research]
- By mid-80s, CS departments became more hostile to students, women.
- To address educator shortages, math professors were often tasked with teaching CS
- 90s and the dot com bubble: Computing as math
- Dot com bubble incentivized students to enter into tech
- Strict enrollment measures were part of this problem. CS programmes gave priority to students who took high school CS (more male dominated than university; women were more likely to encounter CS at university)
- CS programmes became increasingly marketed as being about mathematics and engineering, rather than applicable/relevant to business, languages, or social issues -- women believed CS was an asocial job
- By late 90s, percent of women in CS went from 27% to 17%

Our bubble:

- Enrollment is rising again
- But percentage of women continues to shrink :(

For your teaching:

- Encourage different ways of using, thinking of computing outside math/logic
- Ensure pathways for CS from areas that contain more women
- Encourage a growth mindset, not a “geek gene” to CS
- Discuss the gendered history of computing (why “computer” and “computer-programmer” used to be a female-dominated jobs, why the number of women dropped after every enrollment boom
