Key Points:
For more on colonialism in CS and the removal of personhood in data
- Big Data imbricated in settler colonialism: data collection, use, and reuse has historically, and continues to reproduce patters of settler colonialism
- Addresses the use of the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD)
- (re)use of data removed from it's original purpose/context and bodies is problematic
- data taken, used, reused, and profited off of without going back to/benefiting community it was drawn from
- discusses invisible labour done by Indigenous people and others in generating Big Data
- lack of compensation for collection of what is considered "digital exhaust" (data generated by everyday online activity)
- data is alienated from people, people become alienated from their data
- this paper also extends discussions of land rights to digital territories


How This Can Be Applied To Your Teaching:
- have discussions with students about where the data they use is coming from
- discuss settler colonial histories when talking about data
- talk about the hidden labour involved in data production and collection
- have students consider whether their work is accountable to the people whose data they are using and to their community (what is considered publicly available data? am I using the data in a way that is helping the people it was taken from? (how) are these people being compensated? ... )
