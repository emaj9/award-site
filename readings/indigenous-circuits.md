Key Points:
looking at the history of computing industry reveals the burden of production on women of colour
understanding this history is necessary for understanding digital labour today
Fairchild semiconductor factories set up in Navajo reservations in order to take advantage of high unemployment, "flexible" workforce that could be laid off, the inability of workers to unionize, the inability of workers to search for work elsewhere, and cheap labour...
factory work racialized and gendered — Navajo women presented as the perfect workers bc "nimble fingered," "passive," "submissive," "doing what they love" — companies 'found value' in "primitive" habits
factory work presented as continuation of Indigenous cultural practice ("IC work just like rug making")
this same rhetoric ("nimble fingered," "passive") has been/continues to be used to justify cheap labour by women of colour (Latinas, Asian, African American, Indian, ...)
ICs also presented as being informed by Indian design, despite lack of involvement of indigenous people in Fairchild research and development
Navajo didn't benefit from electronics manufacturing: didn't benefit economically, and their land and bodies were polluted — Navajo nation left to deal with long-term consequences
The existence of cheap female labour is taken for granted in computing today — it is a precondition of the digital device and media we use

How This Can Be Applied To Your Teaching:
talk about where the materials that make CS possible come from (i.e. factories that employ the cheap labour of women of colour)
talk about the colonial history of computing industry
talk about how the history of digital manufacture is gendered and raced
discuss the labour that is taken for granted when we use computers and develop new platforms, applications, and technology
