Key Points:
AI bias is not the only problem with AI (and CS more broadly!)
the process of creating an AI system like the Amazon echo involves a huge and complex network of extraction, including the extraction of:
material resources (and the creation of material waste)
human labour (of workers, and also users!)
this labour is physical and classed (indentured workers in mines, micropayment based crowdsourcing, etc.)
data (using public data to create privatized models)
Popular understandings of AI make it difficult to visualize extractive processes, thus the need for a map (map included!)
Contradiction exists between the “ethereal metaphor of ‘the cloud’” and the physical reality of extraction of minerals from the earth, and labour
The functioning of tech (extractive processes, labour, code) is often hidden —> asymmetry of power (who controls (in)visibility?)
black-boxing, Mechanical Turk, "the cloud"

How This Can Be Applied To Your Teaching:
Talk about the physical realities of cloud-computing! (extraction, labour, environmental impact)
Talk about how this labour is classed (e.g. clickworkers labelling data get fractions of a cent while Bezos makes big bucks)
Talk about the importance of transparency / Talk about the power dynamics in visibility and invisibility
in code (need well documented code!), in how we talk about the cloud, how terms of service are written, in the labour behind our work (making AI work, creating our devices, ...), in the algorithms we use/create, etc...
Help students visualize the extractive processes that go into their work (you can use the map provided by this article - note that this map is just the bare structure of a single system!)
