hi this is labour

As computer scientists, we rely on the use of a huge range of hardware — from microchips millimeters wide to datacenters the size of several football fields. We also rely on vast amounts of energy, labour, materials, and the production of waste in order to create and run this hardware. Curically, the environmental and social impacts of tech production and use are not equally distributed. Teaching students about the materials, labour, pollution and extraction involved in making the technology they use work is crucial for developing students’ understanding of how this technology works and how they can effectively seek social and environmental justice in their work.
    The readings in this section address the labour and resources that go into making computers work. They highlight how this labour and the environmental impacts of computing become invisibilized and concentrated on socio-historically marginalized groups.
